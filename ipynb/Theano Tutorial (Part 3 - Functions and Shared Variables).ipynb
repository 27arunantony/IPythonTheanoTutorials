These are hybrid symbolic and non-symbolic variables whose value may be shared between multiple functions. Shared variables can be used in symbolic expressions just like the objects returned by dmatrices(...) but they also have an internal value that defines the value taken by this symbolic variable in all the functions that use it. It is called a shared variable because its value is shared between many functions. The value can be accessed and modified by the .get_value() and .set_value() methods. We will come back to this soon.\n",

While the updates mechanism can be a syntactic convenience, it is mainly there for *efficiency*.
