      "Using Random Numbers\n",
      "====================\n",
      " \n",
      "Because in Theano you first express everything symbolically and\n",
      "afterwards compile this expression to get functions,\n",
      "using pseudo-random numbers is not as straightforward as it is in\n",
      "NumPy, though also not too complicated.\n",
      " \n",
      "The way to think about putting randomness into Theano's computations is\n",
      "to put random variables in your graph. Theano will allocate a NumPy\n",
      "RandomStream object (a random number generator) for each such\n",
      "variable, and draw from it as necessary. We will call this sort of\n",
      "sequence of random numbers a *random stream*. *Random streams* are at\n",
      "their core shared variables, so the observations on shared variables\n",
      "hold here as well. Theanos's random objects are defined and implemented in \n",
      ":ref:`RandomStreams<libdoc_tensor_shared_randomstreams>` and, at a lower level, \n",
      "in :ref:`RandomStreamsBase<libdoc_tensor_raw_random>`.\n",

      "Brief Example\n",
