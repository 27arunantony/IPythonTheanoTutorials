      "Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:\n",
      "\n",
      "* __tight integration with numpy__ \u2013 Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.\n",
      "* __transparent use of a GPU__ \u2013 Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)\n",
      "* __efficient symbolic differentiation__ \u2013 Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.\n",
      "* __speed and stability optimizations__ \u2013 Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.\n",
      "* __dynamic C code generation__ \u2013 Evaluate expressions faster.\n",
      "* __extensive unit-testing and self-verification__ \u2013 Detect and diagnose many types of mistake.\n",
